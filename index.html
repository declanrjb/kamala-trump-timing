                    <div class="subhead transcript-note">Former President Trump posted more than 30 times on his platform, Truth Social, while
                        Vice President Harris addressed the DNC. The two commentaries, aligned by time stamp, present diverging
                        visions of America.

                        of fact are noted, readers looking for detail should
                        consult independent fact-checks of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/25/g-s1-19480/harris-dnc-fact-check">Harris</a> and <a href="https://time.com/7014304/kamala-harris-dnc-speech-trump-splitscreen-commentary-response-factchecks/">Trump's</a> statements.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="speech-para">OK, let’s get to business. Let’s get to business. All right.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">So, let me start by thanking my most incredible husband, Doug. For being an incredible partner to
                    me, an incredible father to Cole and Ella, and happy anniversary, Dougie. I love you so very much.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">To our president, Joe Biden. When I think about the path that we have traveled together, Joe, I
                    am filled with gratitude. Your record is extraordinary, as history will show, and your character is inspiring. And
                    Doug and I love you and Jill, and are forever thankful to you both.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">And to Coach Tim Walz. You are going to be an incredible vice president. And to the delegates and
                    everyone who has put your faith in our campaign, your support is humbling.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">So, America, the path that led me here in recent weeks was, no doubt, unexpected. But I’m no
                    stranger to unlikely journeys. So, my mother, our mother, Shyamala Harris, had one of her own. And I miss her every
                    day, and especially right now. And I know she’s looking down smiling. I know that.</p>
                <p class="transcript-note">This is likely an example of transcription delay. Former President Trump was almost certainly responding
                    to VP Harris's above compliments to her running mate, Tim Walz, but took longer than the typical 60 seconds
                    to make the post.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-para">So, my mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, traveling from India to California with an
                    unshakable dream to be the scientist who would cure breast cancer.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">When she finished school, she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage. But
                    as fate would have it, she met my father, Donald Harris, a student from Jamaica. They fell in love and got married,
                    and that act of self-determination made my sister, Maya, and me.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">Growing up, we moved a lot. I will always remember that big Mayflower truck, packed with all our
                    belongings, ready to go — to Illinois, to Wisconsin, and wherever our parents’ jobs took us.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">My early memories of our parents together are very joyful ones. A home filled with laughter and
                    music: Aretha, Coltrane and Miles. At the park, my mother would say, “Stay close.” But my father would say, as he
                    smiled, “Run, Kamala, run. Don’t be afraid. Don’t let anything stop you.” From my earliest years, he taught me to be
                    fearless.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">But the harmony between my parents did not last. When I was in elementary school, they split up,
                    and it was mostly my mother who raised us. Before she could finally afford to buy a home, she rented a small
                    apartment in the East Bay.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">In the Bay — in the Bay — you either live in the hills or the flatlands. We lived in the flats. A
                    beautiful, working-class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses and construction workers. All who tended their lawns
                    with pride.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">My mother, she worked long hours. And like many working parents, she leaned on a trusted circle
                    to help raise us. Mrs. Shelton, who ran the day care below us and became a second mother. Uncle Sherman, Aunt Mary,
                    Uncle Freddie, Auntie Chris — none of them family by blood, and all of them family by love.</p>
                <p class="transcript-note">VP Harris's working class roots have become a central pillar of her campaign.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-para">Family who taught us how to make gumbo, how to play chess — and sometimes even let us win. Family
                    who loved us, believed in us, and told us we could be anything and do anything.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">They instilled in us the values they personified — community, faith and the importance of
                    treating others as you would want to be treated. With kindness, respect and compassion. My mother was a brilliant,
                    five-foot-tall brown woman with an accent. And as the eldest child — as the eldest child — I saw how the world would
                    sometimes treat her.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">But my mother never lost her cool. She was tough, courageous, a trailblazer in the fight for
                    women’s health, and she taught Maya and me a lesson that Michelle mentioned the other night. She taught us to never
                    complain about injustice, but do something about it. Do something about it.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">That was my mother. And she taught us — and she always — she also taught us, and she also taught
                    us — and never do anything half-assed. And that is a direct quote. A direct quote.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">I grew up immersed in the ideals of the civil rights movement. My parents had met at a civil
                    rights gathering and they made sure that we learned about civil rights leaders, including the lawyers like Thurgood
                    Marshall and Constance Baker Motley, those who battled in the courtroom to make real the promise of America.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">So, at a young age, I decided I wanted to do that work. I wanted to be a lawyer. And when it came
                    time to choose the type of law I would pursue, I reflected on a pivotal moment in my life.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">You see, when I was in high school, I started to notice something about my best friend, Wanda.
                    She was sad at school, and there were times she didn’t want to go home. So one day I asked if everything was all
                    right, and she confided in me that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather. And I immediately told her she
                    had to come stay with us, and she did.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">This is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor: to protect people like Wanda, because I believe
                    everyone has a right to safety, to dignity and to justice.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">As a prosecutor, when I had a case, I charged it not in the name of the victim, but in the name
                    of the people, for a simple reason. In our system of justice, a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of
                    us. And I would often explain this to console survivors of crime, to remind them: No one should be made to fight
                    alone. We are all in this together.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">And every day, in the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge and I said five words: Kamala
                    Harris, for the people. And to be clear — and to be clear, my entire career, I’ve only had one client: the people.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-para">And, so, on behalf of the people, on behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender
                    or the language your grandmother speaks. On behalf of my mother, and everyone who has ever set out on their own
                    unlikely journey. On behalf of Americans like the people I grew up with — people who work hard, chase their dreams
                    and look out for one another. On behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on
                    Earth, I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">And with this election, and — and with this election, our nation — our nation, with this
                    election, has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the
                    past, a chance to chart a new way forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">And let me say, I know there are people of various political views watching tonight. And I want
                    you to know, I promise to be a president for all Americans. You can always trust me to put country above party and
                    self. To hold sacred America’s fundamental principles, from the rule of law, to free and fair elections, to the
                    peaceful transfer of power.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads and
                    listens; who is realistic, practical and has common sense; and always fights for the American people. From the
                    courthouse to the White House, that has been my life’s work.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, Calif., I stood up for women and children against
                    predators who abused them. As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks, delivered $20 billion for
                    middle-class families who faced foreclosure and helped pass a homeowner bill of rights, one of the first of its kind
                    in the nation.</p>
                <p class="transcript-note">
                    Former President Trump, by contrast, has focused his campaign on economic issues including high prices and inflation.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-para">I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big, for-profit colleges. For workers who
                    were being cheated out of their wages, the wages they were due. For seniors facing elder abuse.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">I fought against the cartels who traffic in guns and drugs and human beings. Who threaten the
                    security of our border and the safety of our communities. And I will tell you, these fights were not easy, and
                    neither were the elections that put me in those offices. We were underestimated at practically every turn.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">But we never gave up. Because the future is always worth fighting for. And that’s the fight we
                    are in right now — a fight for America’s future.</p>
                <p class="transcript-note">Former President Trump's commentary on this point is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/11/nx-s1-5070566/trump-news-conference">inaccurate</a>. While VP Harris was tasked with leading diplomatic efforts with several Central
                    American countries, she was never appointed "border czar" for the Biden administration.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-para">Fellow Americans, this election is not only the most important of our lives, it is one of the
                    most important in the life of our nation. In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man. But the consequences — but
                    the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">Consider — consider not only the chaos and calamity when he was in office, but also the gravity
                    of what has happened since he lost the last election. Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes. When he failed,
                    he sent an armed mob to the U.S. Capitol, where they assaulted law enforcement officers. When politicians in his own
                    party begged him to call off the mob and send help, he did the opposite — he fanned the flames. And now, for an
                    entirely different set of crimes, he was found guilty of fraud by a jury of everyday Americans, and separately — and
                    separately found liable for committing sexual abuse.</p>
                <p class="transcript-note">
                    Former President Trump's statement is false. Both of the cases to which VP Harris refers were tried at the state
                    level with no connection to the Biden administration or its officers.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-para">And consider, consider what he intends to do if we give him
                    power again. Consider his explicit intent to set free violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement
                    officers at the Capitol.</p>
                <p class="transcript-note">This flurry of posts - eight in just over three minutes - is the fastest during the 37 minutes
                    of VP Harris's speech. It coincides with the only section in which VP Harris directly addresses the subject of her opponent.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-para">His explicit intent to jail journalists, political opponents and anyone he sees as the enemy. His
                    explicit intent to deploy our active duty military against our own citizens. Consider, consider the power he will
                    have, especially after the U.S. Supreme Court just ruled that he would be immune from criminal prosecution. Just
                    imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails, and how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United
                    States. Not to improve your life, not to strengthen our national security, but to serve the only client he has ever
                    had: himself.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">And we know, and we know what a second Trump term would look like. It’s all laid out in Project
                    2025, written by his closest advisers. And its sum total is to pull our country back to the past. But America, we
                    are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">We are not going back to when Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. We are not
                    going back to when he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, when insurance companies could deny people with
                    pre-existing conditions. We are not going to let him eliminate the Department of Education that funds our public
                    schools.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">We are not going to let him end programs like Head Start that provide preschool and child care
                    for our children. America, we are not going back.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">And we are charting — and we are charting a new way forward. Forward to a future with a strong
                    and growing middle class because we know a strong middle class has always been critical to America’s success, and
                    building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">And I’ll tell you, this is personal for me. The middle class is where I come from. My mother kept
                    a strict budget. We lived within our means. Yet, we wanted for little and she expected us to make the most of the
                    opportunities that were available to us, and to be grateful for them. Because, as she taught us, opportunity is not
                    available to everyone. That’s why we will create what I call an opportunity economy, an opportunity economy where
                    everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed. Whether you live in a rural area, small town, or big
                    city. And as president, I will bring together labor and workers and small-business owners and entrepreneurs and
                    American companies to create jobs, to grow our economy and to lower the cost of everyday needs like health care and
                    housing and groceries.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">We will provide access to capital for small-business owners and entrepreneurs and founders. And
                    we will end America’s housing shortage, and protect Social Security and Medicare.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">Now compare that to Donald Trump. Because I think everyone here knows, he doesn’t actually fight
                    for the middle class. Not — he doesn’t actually fight for the middle class. Instead, he fights for himself and his
                    billionaire friends. And he will give them another round of tax breaks that will add up to $5 trillion to the
                    national debt.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">And all the while, he intends to enact what, in effect, is a national sales tax, call it a Trump
                    tax, that would raise prices on middle-class families by almost $4,000 a year. Well, instead of a Trump tax hike, we
                    will pass a middle-class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">Friends, I believe America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make
                    their own decisions about their own lives, especially on matters of heart and home.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">But tonight, in America, too many women are not able to make those decisions. And let’s be clear
                    about how we got here: Donald Trump handpicked members of the U.S. Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom.
                    And now, he brags about it.</p>
                <p class="transcript-note">Since the Supreme Court's June 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, abortion rights
                    have become a critical issue on the campaign trail, with VP Harris seeking to draw a clear contrast between her
                    own support for pro-Choice policies and former President Trump's influence in staffing a conservative court. The issue

                <p class="speech-para">In his words, “I did it, and I’m proud to have done it.”</p>
                <p class="speech-para">Well, I will tell you, over the past two years, I’ve traveled across our country, and women have
                    told me their stories. Husbands and fathers have shared theirs. Stories of women miscarrying in a parking lot,
                    developing sepsis, losing the ability to ever again have children, all because doctors are afraid they may go to
                    jail for caring for their patients. Couples just trying to grow their family, cut off in the middle of I.V.F.
                    treatments.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">Children who have survived sexual assault, potentially being forced to carry a pregnancy to term.
                    This is what’s happening in our country because of Donald Trump. And understand, he is not done. As a part of his
                    agenda, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, ban medication abortion and enact a nationwide
                    abortion ban, with or without Congress.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">And get this. Get this. He plans to create a national anti-abortion coordinator, and force states
                    to report on women’s miscarriages and abortions. Simply put, they are out of their minds. And one must ask — one
                    must ask, why exactly is it that they don’t trust women? Well, we trust women. We trust women.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United
                    States, I will proudly sign it into law.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">In this election, many other fundamental freedoms are at stake. The freedom to live safe from gun
                    violence in our schools, communities and places of worship. The freedom to love who you love openly and with pride.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-para">The freedom to breathe clean air, and drink clean water and live free from the pollution that
                    fuels the climate crisis. And the freedom that unlocks all the others: the freedom to vote. With this election, we
                    finally have the opportunity to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">And let me be clear — and let me be clear, after decades in law enforcement, I know the
                    importance of safety and security, especially at our border. Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and
                    conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades. The border patrol endorsed it. But Donald
                    Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign, so he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">Well, I refuse to play politics with our security, and here is my pledge to you. As president, I
                    will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law. I know — I know we
                    can live up to our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants and reform our broken immigration system. We can create
                    an earned pathway to citizenship and secure our border.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">And America, we must also be steadfast in advancing our security and values abroad. As vice
                    president, I have confronted threats to our security, negotiated with foreign leaders, strengthened our alliances
                    and engaged with our brave troops overseas. As commander in chief, I will ensure America always has the strongest,
                    most lethal fighting force in the world. And I will fulfill our sacred obligation to care for our troops and their
                    families, and I will always honor and never disparage their service and their sacrifice.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">I will make sure that we lead the world into the future on space and artificial intelligence.
                    That America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century and that we strengthen, not abdicate, our global
                    leadership. Trump, on the other hand, threatened to abandon NATO. He encouraged Putin to invade our allies. Said
                    Russia could “do whatever the hell they want.”</p>
                <p class="speech-para">Five days before Russia attacked Ukraine, I met with President Zelensky to warn him about
                    Russia’s plan to invade. I helped mobilize a global response — over 50 countries — to defend against Putin’s
                    aggression. And as president, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">With respect to the war in Gaza, President Biden and I are working around the clock, because now
                    is the time to get a hostage deal and a cease-fire deal done.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">And let me be clear. And let me be clear. I will always stand up for Israel’s right to defend
                    itself, and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself, because the people of Israel must never
                    again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on Oct. 7, including unspeakable sexual
                    violence and the massacre of young people at a music festival.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many
                    innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again. The scale of suffering is
                    heartbreaking.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">President Biden and I are working to end this war, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are
                    released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security,
                    freedom and self-determination.</p>
                <p class="transcript-note">Disagreement over the Israel-Hamas war has roiled the Democratic party, and placed a spotlight
                    on VP Harris's intended policies for the region, which have so far not diverged significantly from President Biden's.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-para">And know this: I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend our forces
                    and our interests against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists. I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim
                    Jong-un, who are rooting for Trump. Who are rooting for Trump.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">Because, you know, they know — they know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors. They
                    know Trump won’t hold autocrats accountable because he wants to be an autocrat himself.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">And as president, I will never waver in defense of America’s security and ideals, because in the
                    enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand and I know where the United States belongs.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-para">So, fellow Americans. Fellow Americans. I — I love our country with all my heart. Everywhere I go
                    — everywhere I go, in everyone I meet, I see a nation that is ready to move forward. Ready for the next step in the
                    incredible journey that is America.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">I see an America where we hold fast to the fearless belief that built our nation and inspired the
                    world. That here, in this country, anything is possible. That nothing is out of reach. An America where we care for
                    one another, look out for one another and recognize that we have so much more in common than what separates us. That
                    none of us — none of us has to fail for all of us to succeed.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">And that in unity, there is strength. You know, our opponents in this race are out there every
                    day denigrating America, talking about how terrible everything is. Well, my mother had another lesson she used to
                    teach: Never let anyone tell you who you are. You show them who you are.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">America, let us show each other and the world who we are and what we stand for: Freedom,
                    opportunity, compassion, dignity, fairness and endless possibilities.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">We are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world. And on behalf of our
                    children and our grandchildren and all those who sacrificed so dearly for our freedom and liberty, we must be worthy
                    of this moment.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">It is now our turn to do what generations before us have done, guided by optimism and faith, to
                    fight for this country we love, to fight for the ideals we cherish and to uphold the awesome responsibility that
                    comes with the greatest privilege on Earth: the privilege and pride of being an American. So let’s get out there,
                    let’s fight for it. Let’s get out there, let’s vote for it, and together, let us write the next great chapter in the
                    most extraordinary story ever told.</p>
                <p class="speech-para">Thank you. God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i></h2>
                    <p>Time stamps for Former President Trump's statements were taken from his Truth Social platform, with precision
                        to the nearest second, and converted to Eastern Standard Time (EST). Review of a recorded live CNN broadcast 
                        indicated that VP Harris began speaking at 10:33:36 (EST), with the time to the minute displayed by the broadcaster
                        itself and second precision timed manually by a reporter with a stopwatch.
                    </p>
                    <p>A freely available YouTube recording of the address was downloaded with <a class="tool">yt-dlp</a> and transcribed using <a class="tool">vibe</a>,
                    yielding a JSON file of microsecond precision timestamps for each rough sentence. The transcripts were aligned against
                    VP Harris's phrase "thank you, thank you, please, thank you."</p> 
                    <p>Further calculations and data analysis were performed in <a class="tool">R</a>. Time stamps for Former President Trump's
                    posts were then placed into transcript time by calculating the difference between their time in EST and the moment of
                    the transcript's first line (10:33:36). Manual review of clear direct response posts ("chaos and calamity", etc) suggested 
                    that the typical typing time for a post was approximately 60 seconds, and this offset was subtracted from each post's transcript
                    time. Manual review also matched posts to timestamped lines of the transcript and corrected for transcription errors, and the full
                    transcript was checked against the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/us/politics/kamala-harris-speech-transcript.html">New York Times' version</a>.</p>
